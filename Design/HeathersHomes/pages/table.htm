When bought our home in PA while still living in TX so we weren't able to see the house in person, Heather did her best to Facetime us and send photos to keep us updated on how the home was coming along. Once we arrived in PA our home was more than perfect and the location was EXACTLY what we wanted!! Moving to a new state where you know where nothing is, that's scary. We put our full trust in Heather and plan to do it again with our next home purchase!! Thanks Heather for making this perfect and effortless for our family!</td>
