          <h3>Global Trade</h3>
          <p>
            The present global economic system necessitates trade between international partners.
            Every nation produces natural or manufactured goods, and exports them to nations that
            need those goods for necessity or luxury. Similarly, the very same nation will import
            the goods it needs to function properly aswell. This slowly creates a system in which
            nations, and by extension their people, become very reliant on other nations for the
            goods and services they enjoy and take for granted every day. We will go more in depth
            with this idea later.

          <h3>Post-War System</h3>
          <p>
            After the second world war, the United States emerged as the sole superpower in the
            free, first world. They created and fostered an economic system of free, international
            trading that would begin to lay the foundation for the geo-economic system we enjoy
            today. It is strange to think that less than one-hundred years ago, nations still held
            colonies and inefficiently extracted their resources. The power of the United States
            Navy alone is to be thanked for the ability to project such safety to the world's
            international trade.

          <h3>International Peace</h3>
          <p>
            What else is global interdependence? It is the idea that you and I can be apart of a
            broader, global commmunity of trade, that has previously been unheard of. It brings with
            it challenges, but also helps us explore eachothers cultures, religions, and values in
            constructive ways. We have the ability to use these economic connections to foster more
            personal ones. These can in turn help further promote peace to something not limited by
            the necessity of economics.
