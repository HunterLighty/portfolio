          <h3>Economic Freedom</h3>
          <p>
            A side effect of this global economic phenomenon? You can purchase almost anything, from
            anywhere, for relatively cheap! This gives people the freedom to purchase exactly what
            they want, when they want it. You can have cars from Europe or Japan, toys from China,
            Software from the United States, and video games produced in Sweden! Never before have
            we lived in such a time that anyone could actually touch all the corners of the world in
            such a way!
          </p>

          <h3>Interpersonal Peace</h3>
          <p>
            What else does this mean on a scale bigger than you or me? It means nations that rely on
            eachother for natural resources or manufactured goods are forced to find diplomatic and
            peaceful alternatives to conflict. And while this may not be a hundred percent
            foolproof, it has certainly shown over the last eighty years that the world can live in
            relative peace. Instead, nations choose to fight on the economic front, fighting for the
            capital of the consumers worldwide. This means that many men and women are no longer
            subject to the destructive nature of warfare, and can instead lead peaceful, happy
            lives.

          <h3>Prosperity</h3>
          <p>
            The ability for nations to trade freely without the threat of foreign occupation has
            resulted in nations becoming wealthier overtime. Instead of funneling all their
            resources out to a colonizer, nations in the third world receive direct compensation for
            their natural resources and labor. This means that the people of these nations are also
            experiencing growing freedoms akin to that in the first world. More money in their
            economies from the first world means they become more rich over time, and can provide
            better lives for themselves and their people. This is a trend that will only continue
            with positive attitudes towards free trade.
