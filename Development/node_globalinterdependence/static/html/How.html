          <h3>Consumer Goods</h3>
          <p>
            For starters, you and I have the ability to experience things our forefathers could only
            have dreamed of! Every product we touch is connected to international trade in most
            cases. That cell phone? It's components are from Asia. Those fruits you enjoy? Many come
            from South America. These connections exist in ways we take for granted, a good exercise
            to explore what life would be like without the benefits of Global Interdependence is to
            try and find all the items in your room or house that are entirely domestically
            produced.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div align="center" class="col-md">
          <img src="../img/HOWIMG2.jpg" />
          <h3>Employment</h3>
          <p>
            Our jobs, be it producing goods or providing services, can often lead us to interacting
            with foreign clients. This is just one way in which we interact with the system of
            Global Interdependence. Think about where the products or services you contribute to end
            up, and think about the impacts your job has on the people living in those places.
            Without Global Interdependence, you aswell as others would be limited to domestic
            services and goods, which can often be of a lower quality, more expensive, or both.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div align="center" class="col-md">
          <img src="../img/HOWIMG3.jpg" />
          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>
            The need to trade and interact with the global community also causes another interesting
            effect. Children of this modern system are heavily encouraged to learn about other
            cultures, religions, and most importantly languages. Spanish and English in the West are
            particularly prominent languages to know for interacting with clients in the United
            States and South America. This of course helps us broaden our horizons and absorb
            different cultures, while also meeting new people we otherwise wouldn't have paid any
            mind to due to the language barriers involved.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            So you see, Global Interdependence has affected most of our lives from the day we were
            born.
